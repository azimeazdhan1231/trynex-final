Create a landing page for a website named "TryneX" with the following specifications:
- Design: Ultra-modern, dynamic, and premium impression with a clean layout, reflecting July 2025 trends as of 04:55 AM +06, Friday, July 18, 2025, optimized for perfect responsiveness across all screen sizes with precise breakpoints (e.g., 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px) to prevent issues like auto-opening navbars on smaller screens.
- Files: Provide static files including index.html, styles.css, script.js, and a new products.html page, all organized in the root directory with clear separation for maintainability, ready for Netlify deployment.
- Admin Panel: Integrate Netlify CMS for content management, including an admin folder with index.html and config.yml for managing products (add, edit, delete), categories, site content, orders, promo codes, banners, offers, and order statuses. Ensure the admin panel is accessible via /admin, works with Git-based deployment, and reflects real-time data with functional category tabs, avoiding blank sections.
- Theme: Use a golden (#d4af37), white, and black color scheme applied dynamically throughout with gradients, hover effects, subtle 3D transitions, and advanced animations (e.g., fade-in, slide-in, parallax, 3D tilt effects) for a premium feel across all devices.
- Content: Include detailed product information for Facebook catalog ads, featuring an expanded list of at least 50 products with realistic images and descriptions (use https://via.placeholder.com/300x300?text=Product+Name if real images are unavailable). Products and categories should be editable via the admin panel:
