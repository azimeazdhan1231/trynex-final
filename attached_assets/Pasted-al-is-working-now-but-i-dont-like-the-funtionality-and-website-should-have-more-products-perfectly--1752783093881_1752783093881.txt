al is working now but i dont like the funtionality and website should have more products perfectly, and website responsiveness and breakpoint and for all screens perfectly design and everything like that is missing thats why i can see in smaller screen it is showing something like the nav bar things auto opened in smaller screens, and then create a new page called products , where homepage or any pages all products with advanced features as per my business modal make it with your sense but make sure to connect everything in admin panel also, and create a search option perfecly also but make sure work on all device and do not overlap and work like youtube search algorithm and then see the admin panell, when i click on category i see some tabs but those are blanks or nothing here,, you can see the reference image 2,3, etc images i shared those needed to be more funtionalityfull and visible the realtime website data perfectly and if possible add more advanced features too. and then maske sure everything is done and then give a check again and ensure all ok then i will push the updated directories to github thats it. and there id no option to get the order or manage the order or also in website there is no option or feature to confirm the order from website without going to whatsapp, keep whatsapp as optinoal, and make it like people can do order but other processes keep same just after last order proceed button will now create unique order id with dynamic responsive dashboard and copy feaures and they can track their order from track status page like that,, and from admin panel admin will get the updated orders and ther will be lots of features to update the order status and payment status etc or add new instruction etc............. and for clientside from cart modal ther will be a add a new option called: Any Instruction a text box where people will input their wishes or needed things if needed, anyway you need to understand me how i need this ok.... and then look at the admin panel there is no option to add any responsive for any screen popup offer or any other kind of banner offer creating features needed, promo code creation needed and exisiting promo can be managed also and in site cart modal there should be added the promo section which will actually work perfectly realtime if any promo added by the admin side,, and look the address if client select in dhaka metro area than keep delivery fee to 80 tk and outside dhaka 120-150tk , you determine it automatically,, and see there is in payment page cart modal page i can see there is bkash nagad rocket but this box cannot be selectable and thats why it cannot be clear client is paid from where, so update this things using sophisticated sense of yours and check 2 times everything is as perfect as i want ............after that make sure website everything is perfectly and completely working and also reflecting to admin panel same thing and can be managed and working everything and make sure order updates will also work ... hope you will do this everything i wanted...
